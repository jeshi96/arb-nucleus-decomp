This directory contains sub-directories organized by problem.  Each
problem sub-directory contains:
* A testing file, which can be built using Bazel and GoogleTest
  (please see the main README for detailed instructions on running the
  tests).
* A specification folder discussing how to run the test on graph
  inputs, and any special problem-specific information (e.g., sources
  for single-source problems, or the setting of algorithm parameters).
